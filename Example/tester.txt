#This is the tester. It is sage code saved to a .txt file, for the same reason as key.txt. 
#The tester goes through a list of test cases and compares the student output to the key output. Each correct answer adds one to their score.
#The output score is the fraction of cases they got correct on each part; this could easily be changed to a raw score or something else.
#Test cases can either be generated randomly (as in this case) or hardcoded in.

score = [0,0]  #every student starts at zero
